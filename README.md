    I work at the intersection of engineering, design psychology, and craft. I care about quality, simplicity, and tools that feel good to use. I believe software is a form of craftsmanship, and that even small, well-made tools can transform how people think, feel, and perform. My philosophy is simple: build with intention, reduce friction, respect human attention, and bring clarity to complex systems. The goal is always the same: create calm, minimise noise, and enable deep, meaningful work. This underpins my broader focus on Engineering Experience.

    Most of my open-source work centres on Structural Engineering: building practical utilities and native toolchains that people love to use. I also contribute to the   <a href="https://www.istructe.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE)</a> and serve as Vice-Chair of the  <a href="https://www.istructe.org/get-involved/panels-and-committees/digital-workflows-computational-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Workflows & Computational Design Panel (DWCD)</a>. In my day job, I manage a portfolio of internal software tools at WSP where I apply the same principles at scale.

    I write about Engineering Experience, design psychology, and practical wisdom for better work at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7261809617679052800/" target="_blank">Optimal Engineer</a>. I also publish <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7389619439480053760/" target="_blank">Handmade Technology</a>, a newsletter for AEC Developers exploring craft, code, and the tools shaping the built environment. You can also find me on <a href="https://jsbayley.substack.com" target="_blank">Substack</a> where I write about simplicity, craft, and effort well spent.
